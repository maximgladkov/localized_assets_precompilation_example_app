== Localized assets

Prototype of assets localization for Rails 3+.

This technique allows to use Rails i18n helpers inside js.erb and css.erb files 
to add localization. Localized versions of assets are created on compile.

== Testing

In development mode, it uses single asset file with correct locale.

In production mode, use `rake assets:precompile` to create multiple versions of 
localized assets.
